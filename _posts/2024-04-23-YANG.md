I wrote up an Nmap guide for a class I took with City Colleges of Chicago about Nmap. Here it is:

## Intentions

This guide is written to give an introduction into what Nmap is, what you might use it for, how it works, and how to go about using it. After studying this guide you should have an advanced-beginner's understanding of what Nmap is actually doing, how to use Nmap, and knowledge of some of Nmap's advanced capabilities. 

Nmap is very powerful and configurable, and can be used for scanning and enumerating from as much as the entire internet down to just individual devices on your home intranet. That power and configurability can make some Nmap documentation overwhelming. As this guide is intended to give the reader an advanced-beginner's understanding of basic Nmap usage, it purposely excludes quite a lot about Nmap on purpose in an attempt to focus the information given towards common usage and enumeration patterns. 

As this guide is intended to also give the reader an advanced-beginner's understanding of what Nmap is actually doing and how it works, it purposely includes some information that is not necessary for basic Nmap usage. Much advanced Nmap knowledge assumes you have a working understanding of a lot of network fundamentals. I tried to thread the needle between TMI and TLDR with the goal of slotting this guide somewhere in the middle of the documentation spectrum between a cheatsheet and the Nmap author's 468 page book on the tool. I also tried to present relevant detailed information roughly in the order of when it is encountered during Nmap use from more basic to less basic. Sometimes acronyms are used and explained more in depth shortly after to avoid info dumping all in one go.

Information for this guide is sourced from the Nmap website at Nmap.org, Wikipedia, TryHackMe's Nmap module, and Chris Greer + David Bombal's Nmap course on Udemy. All of those are excellent sources of additional information and documentation on Nmap, network protocols, and security tools.


## TLDR 6 W's;

-What  : Nmap (short for "Network Mapper") is a tool for network exploration and security auditing.

-When  : Nmap is a tool you would reach for when you need to find more information about the structure of a network and details about its hosts.

-Why   : Nmap is a powerful, popular, and well documented tool which is open source and generally free to use.

-Who   : Nmap was originally written by Gordon Lyon and continues to be maintained by him and many other open source contributors.

-Where : Nmap comes already installed in many Linux and Unix based operating systems, including Kali. It is available for download at Nmap.org for Linux, macOS, Windows, and other platforms.

-How   : Nmap is a command line tool. On Linux and most UNIXs (including macOS) simply type the command 'nmap' and hit enter to see a summary of the most common options available to the tool.



## A Word of Caution

A full deep dive into the legal considerations of using nmap is well outside of the scope of this guide, but it is worth noting that network scanning and enumeration is not always legal. Even scanning hosts or networks with permission may still get you in trouble if the network you are scanning from is highly controlled (eg. scanning from Work or School without authorization to do so). **I highly encourage you to only scan from and scan hosts or networks that you have permission for.** If you are interested, Nmap has a page with some thoughts and considerations to be aware of regarding scanning legality on their homepage [here](https://nmap.org/book/legal-issues.html).

For the purposes of practicing scanning there are a number of sites that are available to scan publicly with permission such as the server run by the Nmap maintainers at scanme.nmap.org. Some learning platforms such as TryHackMe or HackTheBox will require enumeration using Nmap as part of identifying hosts and enumerating networks for practice as well. You can also scan your own home environment, or virtualized environments you create yourself. 


## Getting Started - What's the point?

Nmap is a something like a multitool for network enumeration. Imagine you're a new System Administrator at a growing company. The boss's college aged kid has been helping set up computers, printers, and even a couple servers at the office for years but you're the first proper IT person they've hired. Naturally, there is no standardization and no documentation. How do you inventory what devices are running on the network? What their hostnames or IP addresses are? What they're used for? Nmap can help you figure out all of that (or at least make educated guesses) and more without even stepping away from your desk. Those same abilities (and more!) also make it an effective security tool, both offensively and defensively. 

## What the heck do we mean by network enumeration anyways?

In the context of Nmap, enumeration means systematically scanning network components to try and identify active hosts, open network ports on those active hosts, services running on those open ports, and possibly even versions of those services. Sometimes based on responses to specific poking and prodding Nmap is able to identify what operating system the active host is running, vulnerabilities of service or OS, characteristics of firewalls and IPSs, and even signs of malware infection. As the name of the tool suggests, one could quite literally map out a network using the tool (and indeed that is a functionality of the GUI version Zenmap).


## Going Deeper - What does Nmap actually do during host discovery??

Before we really get down and dirty here it is important to say that Nmap is quite restricted if ran as an unprivileged user on Linux or other UNIXs (including macOS) because they do not allow unprivileged users to send and receive raw TCP packets. If an unprivileged scan is launched from one of these systems Nmap will use a simpler scan using a built-in system command 'CONNECT' (which has some limitations) or will deny the scan with an error that the scan type requires root privileges. You can elevate your privileges using sudo as necessary to get around that limitation. Note that for the rest of this guide scans are assumed to be run with the necessary privileges.

With that said: its most basic use, Nmap is ran with just a target to scan.

Understanding what Nmap is actually doing on a default scan requires that we rewind a bit to explain some network fundamentals. (OK maybe a lot...)


### What comes first - Resolving IP addresses


**0** - IP addresses

Nmap primarily works by probing devices using specially crafted Internet Protocol (IP) packets with the goal of receiving responses that give us information about the hosts. To be able to send these specially crafted IP packets Nmap needs to have an IP address for each target we provide. How does Nmap know the IP address of a supplied target hostname or domain name? Two primary ways, but before we get there: What is an IP address?

An IP address is a numerical label assigned to a device that uses Internet Protocol for communication. Computers use IP addresses to indicate where hosts or networks are so that they can then attempt to determine a route and communicate with those hosts or networks. There are two versions of Internet Protocol in common use: IPv4 and IPv6. While the essential functionality between the two is more or less the same the IP addresses of each differ in looks greatly. IPv4 addresses are groups of 4 numbers between 0-255 separated by periods, such as: 

45.33.32.156
8.8.8.8
192.168.123.234

IPv6 addresses are 8 groups of 4 hexadecimal numbers between 0000-ffff separated by colons, such as:

2600:3c01:0000:0000:f03c:91ff:fe18:bb2f
2607:f8b8:4009:0814:0000:0000:0000:200e
fe80:0000:0000:0000:2c3c:9dff:fec1:91ad

If you directly supply an IP address to Nmap as a target, obviously does not need to resolve the IP address itself. However, it will instead try to do what is known as a reverse DNS lookup to pull up the domain name or hostname associated with the device. Nmap does this because often devices are named with relevance to their functionality or location, and devices on different subdomains may give hints on additional areas or targets to scan.

**1a** - If scanning a hostname (or for IPs on the local network): 

A 'hostname' in common usage typically refers to a name of a specific device on the same local network as yourself. However, in 'technical computer networking speak' a hostname refers to a label of a device connected to a computer network, including the internet. In other words, www.google.com is technically speaking a hostname. Know that official Nmap documentation online uses 'hostname' to refer to both local network device names (the common 'hostname') as well as domain names.

Practically speaking, for Nmap the distinction matters slightly because when scanning the common 'hostname' and / or devices on the same local network  Nmap works slightly differently than it will if given a domain name (domain.tld),  a fully qualified domain name (host.domain.tld), or a non-local IP address. When scanning hosts that Nmap thinks are on the local network (hostname or IP) the default scan type is an ARP scan for IPv4. NDP serves a similar function for IPv6 addresses, but IPv6 only local networks are rare so we're gonna skip that one here. 

ARP (**A**ddress **R**esolution **P**rotocol) is normally used by local network devices to identify the hardware MAC address associated with a given local IPv4 address to communicate with the device at that IP. Without the MAC (**M**edia **A**ccess **C**ontrol) address, senders are unable to direct IP packets to the correct device. So how does ARP work? Essentially: If device A that wants to speak to device B and only knows of B by its IP 10.0.0.2, device A will send what is called a broadcast packet that automatically goes out to every MAC address on the network. The broadcast packet asks if anyone is 10.0.0.2 and what is their specific MAC address. If device B receives that broadcast it will respond back saying "Hi I'm 10.0.0.2 and my MAC Address is 12:34:56:78:90:AB". Of course if there is no device B at 10.0.0.2 then there will be no response. 

If we ask Nmap to enumerate a large network, it will send a bunch of broadcast packets quickly to try and determine which addresses to follow up on: 

![A screenshot of a Wireshark scan showing almost all ARP broadcasts from one MAC address. Each broadcast asks for an IP one higher than the last. There is one packet of a response from a host that is up](/assets/images/nmap4.png)

If we use Nmap to scan an IP on the same local network as our device it will automatically jump straight into an ARP scan to determine if devices are up at any given IP. If we use Nmap to scan a hostname on the same local network Nmap will first send the hostname to our closest DNS resolver (for a typical home network that would be your internet router) asking if it has any records for the given hostname, and if the target hostname has a record the DNS resolver will return that IP. Once Nmap has the IP for the hostname, it will ping the IP using ARP to determine 

If we get responses back from any devices at those IPs we can then map them and set aside those IPs to scan in other ways for more information. Why use ARP at all? Why not just use TCP/IP or ICMP ping scans for everything? The long and short answers basically boil down to the fact that ARP scans are a lot faster and more efficient when they can be used, particularly when trying to enumerate larger networks. Why not use ARP then for everything? ARP only really works on local networks and cannot be used to enumerate beyond your router.

_Enumerating 255 addresses for further scanning in less than 3 seconds_


**1b** - If scanning a Domain Name: DNS resolution

If targeting a domain name Nmap will first send a DNS request to resolve the IP address of the given domain name. Once Nmap has an IP address it will start scanning the IP as specified by command options or defaults.

What is a domain name? A domain name is a more specific hostname also used for identifying a machine on a network. Domain names exist to make it easier to identify networked resources by associating numeric IP addresses with (generally) more human readable identifiers. For example, the first two IPv6 addresses listed above correspond to scanme.nmap.org and google.com respectively, and those domain names are significantly easier to remember than their numerical IP addresses. Domain names differ from the common 'hostnames' in that they also specify what is called a **T**op **L**evel **D**omain or TLD such as .com, .net, .edu, or many others.

Note that the 'Domain Name' nmap.org can represent a different machine than the 'Fully Qualified Domain Name' scanme.nmap.org, which might be different than test.scanme.nmap.org. The distinction is important because if DNS resolves nmap.org to a different IP address than scanme.nmap.org (as it does as of writing) then running an Nmap scan on the target nmap.org can give different results than the target scanme.nmap.org because they refer to different hosts.

What is DNS? DNS (short for **D**omain **N**ame **S**ystem) is a service primarily used to associate domain names and their offered services with IP addresses. The process of asking a DNS server for the IP addresses associated with a given domain name is called 'DNS resolution'. DNS resolution is necessary beyond giving us memorable website names because the association between a specific IP address and a specific host or service on a host is not permanent and can be changed for a variety of reasons. Domains can also represent a group of IPs used for load balancing or simply offer multiple services such as web page hosting and email services under one parent domain name.

![One domain offering web services and mail services, and the mail service DNS resolving to multiple IPs](/assets/images/nmap5.png)

_One domain offering web services and mail services, and the mail service DNS resolving to multiple IPs_

By default when scanning  Nmap will first send two DNS requests for a domain, one for an IPv4 address and one for an IPv6 address. If DNS returns only one address then Nmap will begin scanning that IP address. If DNS returns multiple addresses, then Nmap will begin scanning only the first IP address listed in the DNS query response, preferring IPv4 if both versions are available. Know that as mentioned previously Nmap is very configurable, and as such if you prefer for Nmap to ever use non-default behavior (in this case maybe scanning all addresses returned by DNS or preferring IPv6), you can find options online that will specify the scan behavior you want.

### What comes second - Is the host up?

If we used an ARP scan during IP resolution, we already know the host was up because it responded to our request. If we were able to resolve an IP using DNS that might imply that a host is up at that IP, but just because the device doesn't respond to your terminal ping (aka an ICMP Echo request) doesn't mean the host is down. 

In 2009 the Nmap team did some research against a selection of internet hosts and found that 62.47% of hosts would respond to an ICMP Echo ping. Of the little more than 1/3 of hosts that did not respond to an ICMP Echo, nearly 70% responded to one of a TCP SYN on port 443, a TCP ACK on port 80, or an ICMP Timestamp request. By combining those four pings (now the default pings for host discovery in Nmap), one can bringing the number of discovered host IPs all the way up to 88.64% without dramatically slowing down the host discovery process.

This is where the configurability of Nmap can start to become a blessing and a curse. Although the default settings of Nmap are well thought out and highly effective, occasionally it might make sense to add or remove options based off of your intended use. As an introduction into the concept of the pings we will review the default four in order of reliability, but remember there are other options available and ways to significantly customize your pings.

**2a** - ICMP echo request, Lord of the Pings

ICMP (**I**nternet **C**ontrol **M**essage **P**rotocol) is a protocol used within IP packets for networked devices to communicate various operational information indicating success or failure when communicating with another IP network device. For network enumeration the ICMP Echo command is substantially the most effective and often used host discovery tool.

To be technically RFC compliant all hosts need to have a function that responds to ICMP echo requests with an ICMP echo reply. By receiving that reply, Nmap knows there is a device behind a given IP. In reality it is more common now for hosts to not reply to ICMP echo requests or for the requests to be blocked by a firewall in the name of security.

ICMP does not require the use of ports because ports aren't a thing at the IP network level, you need to go one step up to TCP/UDP to need to worry about those. This makes ping scans very simple and quite fast.

**2b** - TCP SYN

TCP (**T**ransmission **C**ontrol **P**rotocol) is used on top of IP to try and create reliable and ordered connections for applications to build on top of. TCP requires that the two endpoints create a connection prior to any data being sent between the two, and that connection is established by way of a "three-way handshake". 

The first step of the handshake is for the client to sent a TCP packet tagged to SYNchronize, or start, the connection. If a server exists that is accepting TCP connections on the port specified then it will send back a response TCP packet tagged to SYNchronize and ACKnowledge the connection. The client will then respond a final time with a TCP packet tagged to ACKnowledge and lock in the connection, after which the client and server would theoretically start communicating by sending data to each other. That SYN, SYN/ACK, ACK handshake is what allows Nmap to perform host discovery by sending only TCP SYN pings. Once the SYN/ACK comes back from the other endpoint, Nmap knows that there is a device behind a given IP.

The catch is that TCP requires the use of ports during scanning, which means that if you want to do host discovery using any TCP scan you need to not only have the right IP but also an open port. Nmap will by default TCP SYN 'ping' only port 443 during host discovery. Port 443 is typically used for HTTPS web traffic. Once a host is discovered (regardless of which ping type indicated a host is up) then a default Nmap scan will TCP scan additional common ports for enumerating more information about the host.

**2c** - TCP ACK

As mentioned above, the TCP ACK is normally seen at the end of a normal three-way handshake to lock in the connection for sending data. If a client only sends a server a TCP ACK, the server will respond with a TCP RST (short for ReSeT) because no connection has been established yet by the first two steps of the handshake. That TCP RST indicates to Nmap during host discovery that there is a device behind the given IP. As with SYN pings, the ACK also needs to go to a port that is open. During a default scan Nmap will TCP ACK ping port 80 during host discovery. Port 80 is typically used by HTTP web traffic.

You may be wondering now, when would I use a SYN ping over an ACK ping or the other way around? The trick with an ACK ping is if a host is behind a simple firewall configured only to block inbound TCP SYN packets, a TCP ACK could essentially pass through that firewall and get a RST response from the server on the other side. 

Why can't a firewall block inbound ACK packets too? Well it turns out ACK packets are not only used for locking in the connection during the three-way handshake. ACKs get used regularly in TCP to continuously confirm receipt of data bi-directionally, so blocking inbound ACKs would break TCP by eliminating the ability for devices outside the firewall to confirm receipt. Essentially, you can't block incoming ACKS with a simple firewall...

Why not only use ACK pings? The catch here is that not all firewalls are simple. Simple stateless firewalls don't keep track of the status of a connection and will only rely on rules such as: Incoming SYN? Nah, or Incoming ACK? Sure. 

Stateful firewalls on the other hand do keep track of the status of connections and can use that status to make better informed decisions on what to block and what to allow. Following the examples above, a stateful firewall can do the same simple: Incoming SYN? Nah. For the Incoming ACK packet however, a stateful firewall can look and see if there is a connection associated with that incoming ACK, and if there isn't one then say no thanks cya never. If there is an established connection then the stateful firewall knows that the connection originated from inside the firewall and the ACK can therefore be allowed in. Stateful firewalls can be configured to still allow incoming SYN connections to resources that are intended to be publicly accessible (say a web server or VPN gateway) if you SYN them on their open ports, but that requires more specific enumeration and time than the quick pings we're talking about now if the service doesn't run on port 80 or 443 and blocks ICMP requests.

Just remember that if you can find open ports from an ACK scan that do not turn up during a SYN scan, a stateless firewall is likely between yourself and the target.

With all of that said, you may be wondering again: When would I use a SYN ping over an ACK ping or the other way around? The real answer is you probably want to use both as much as possible. ACKs have the ability to sneak through stateless firewalls, but won't be able to detect publicly accessible ports through stateful firewalls like SYNs will. Nmap offers both and their documentation recommends both as well. 

**2d** - ICMP Timestamp

The last of the four default host discovery pings is the ICMP timestamp ping. This scan is relatively straightforward and ultimately relies on the fact that a not insignificant amount of administrators that block IMCP echos do not also disable or block another feature of ICMP that is supposed to be used for syncing time between devices. Like ICMP echo requests, no port is necessary because ports are not a concept at the IP layer. If Nmap receives a response then naturally, the host is up for further enumeration.


To wrap up this section on networking fundamental details relevant to how Nmap does what it does, lets do the briefest of recaps:

-When given a target to scan Nmap will by default:

If given an IP: Do a reverse DNS lookup, determine if the device is on the local network, do an ARP ping if so, or a default host discovery scan if not

If given a hostname: try a DNS resolve with the nearest system DNS resolver, if the host is known on the local network Nmap will do an ARP ping

If given a domain name: do a DNS resolve with the system DNS server, scan the first IP address returned from the query (preferring IPv4 over v6 if both returned) using a default host discovery scan

-The default host discovery scan is ARP when available, and if not then the following 4 pings simultaneously:

ICMP echo request (Host is up if  ICMP echo reply received)
TCP SYN on port 443 (Host is up if TCP SYN/ACK received)
TCP ACK on port 80 (Host is up if TCP RST received)
ICMP timestamp (Host is up if ICMP timestamp reply received)

If any of those pings returns a host, the next step would be to execute TCP scans to try and enumerate open ports and maybe information about their available services.


### Before moving on to port scans

 Of course Nmap is able to directly scan IPs if targeted, but what may not be as obvious is Nmap is also able to scan groups of IPs in one go. There are a handful of ways of specifying to Nmap how to do so, three of which we will cover.

Possibly the most simple way to scan multiple addresses is to specify a file containing a list of domain names, hostnames, IPs, and / or IP networks. This is done using the -iL option followed by the name of the list file. 

```
cat hostlist.txt
SLTTP1                ## A local hostname on my personal network
scanme.nmap.org       ## A domain name
1.1.1.1               ## An IP address (for CloudFlare's public DNS service)
```


IPs or IP ranges can also be specified by using commas and hyphens for each number between periods.

```
192.168.1.0-10           ## will scan IPs beginning with 192.168.1 and ending from 0 to 10 in the last octet

192.168.1.1,3,5,7        ## will scan IPs beginning with 192.168.1 and ending in 1,3,5,7

192.168.0-2.53,200-210   ## will scan IPs beginning with 192.168, then 0 to 2, with the last octet ending in 53 or from 200-210
```

IP ranges can also be represented in CIDR notation, which is a shorthand for expressing subnet values. Subnetting is used to isolate networks from each other and reduce congestion on the network. CIDR ranges in IPv4 go from 0-36, where 0 represents all of the IPv4 address space and 36 represents a maximum of one host. 

```
192.168.1.0/24    ## equivalent to 256 IP addresses 192.168.1.0-255

10.0.0.0/8        ## equivalent to about 16 million IP addresses from 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255
```


## Port scanning

Port scanning is where we can start really gathering more information beyond just "is this device up and responding to our pings". 

What is a port? A port is an abstraction built into TCP and UDP for distinguishing between different communication channels. Like MAC addresses identify hardware addresses in networks and IP addresses are used to identify machines and routes on networks, ports identify specific applications in use on a machine. 

Ports are organized into ranges where ports 0-1023 are known as well-known ports, ports 1024 to 49151 are known as registered ports, and ports 49152 to 65535 are known as dynamic ports. Unix based systems require services that receive traffic from a well-known port to run as a privileged user, with the intention of creating some assurance that remote clients are connecting to a valid service started by an administrator. Other than that wrinkle there is no real enforcement mechanism to make you use a specific port for a specific service, and unofficial uses of well-known or registered ports is not totally uncommon. With that said generally certain services use certain specific ports as a standard practice often enough to make educated assumptions about what services are running behind an open port. For example, as mentioned above TCP port 80 is generally used for HTTP and TCP port 443 is generally used for HTTPS. 

By default Nmap will scan 1000 common ports on any hosts it identifies as up. As mentioned in the section on TCP ACK pings, different scan types have different advantages for enumerating which ports are open based off of the characteristics of the targets and their security posture.

### Port states

It is important to understand the states of a port as reported by Nmap. There are 6, but you are typically only going to see 3 unless you are really enumerating the heck out of your targets.

"Open" ports are ports where an application is actively accepting TCP connections or UDP packets. Using an example from the default ping scans, an open port would be like a TCP SYN on port 443 receiving a TCP SYN/ACK back. We know the target is trying to complete the TCP handshake and therefore we know that a service exists behind that port. For pentesters and malicious hackers these services represent a possible avenue for attack. For administrators they represent services available and necessary to secure.

"Closed" ports are ports where the port is accessible (not being blocked by a firewall or other device), but there is no application listening. For TCP SYN scans this would be from receiving a TCP RST back. While having ports accessible without an application listening behind them is unlikely to be a security threat, generally speaking administrators should consider blocking off closed ports to prevent accidentally making unintended services available and making offensive enumeration harder.

"Filtered" ports are ports where Nmap is unable to determine if the port is open or closed because no response is received back by Nmap when one otherwise would normally be expected. For example, recall the how the TCP ACK ping can get around a stateless firewall blocking inbound TCP SYNs. In this situation, the SYNs never get received by the target because the firewall is blocking them, so the target will never send back a SYN/ACK for an open port or a RST for a closed port.

"Unfiltered" ports are ports where a TCP ACK ping is able to reach the target to receive back a RST. Because the only standard response to an ACK without a connection is a RST, Nmap cannot determine if the port is open or closed, only that the ACK is reaching the target. Confusingly, this port state doesn't necessarily mean that the port is actually completely unfiltered, just that it is unfiltered to a random TCP ACK. As mentioned previously, if a SYN scan is displaying a port as filtered an ACK can potentially sneak past a stateless firewall to see if a device is up, but cannot further determine if the device is open or closed on that port.

"Open|Filtered" ports are ports where the scan is only able to conclusively identify a closed port. The name should be read as "Open or Filtered". UDP scans and IP scans are the main ones that can return this result, although some special malformed TCP packet scans sometimes used to try and enumerate past stateless firewalls and identify hosts can return this as well.

Last and maybe least, "Closed|Filtered" ports are port where the scan is only able to conclusively identify an open port. The only scan that can return this is the exotic and clever TCP Idle scan which is worth reading about if only to realize how neat and big brained it is.

### Port scan types 

With all of that said we can finally finish off this guide with a couple basic scan types. If you've made it this far, congratulations. You're actually a champ for reading this. In fact, if you DM me on discord with the flag CCC-NCL-READS I will give you a digital high-five and buy you a beverage of your choice at the next Burbsec we're both at for making it this far.

Note that if you managed to comprehend ~~these deranged ramblings~~ the groundwork laid throughout this document, understanding how the scans actually work is relatively straightforward.

**3a** - TCP Connect (default for unprivileged scans on UNIX OS's) -sT

A TCP Connect scan is typically used whenever Nmap is unable to execute other scans because it lacks privileges to do so. It is slower and less efficient than the standard TCP SYN scan because it uses the system built-in `connect` to try and enumerate ports, which assumes it is trying for a target that is up and will complete and closes any TCP connections that it receives back. As with a TCP SYN scan, receiving back a SYN/ACK indicates an open port, receiving a RST indicates a closed port, and receiving no response indicates a filtered port.

**3b** - TCP SYN (Sometimes also known as a Stealth scan) -sS

A TCP SYN scan is the default scan for Nmap. It is fast, efficient, and returns pretty significant information on the status of the hosts.  During a SYN scan receiving back a SYN/ACK indicates an open port, receiving a RST indicates a closed port, and receiving no response indicates a filtered port. It is sometimes known as a "Stealth" scan because the belief is that by not completing the full handshake and establishing a connection, there will be no logging of the probe.

**3c** - TCP ACK -sA

A TCP ACK scan might be used when a SYN scan is returning filtered ports and you want to check and see if you can detect the presence of a stateless firewall. If an ACK scan receives a RST back, it indicates that the host and port exists, but no more. Used in combination with other scans one can make educated guesses about the security posture of the host.

**3d** - UDP Scans -sU

We haven't really spoken much about UDP (**U**ser **D**atagram **P**rotocol) up to this point because it is generally slower and more complicated than TCP scanning. However, there are some major services (and high value targets if you're an attacker) used by UDP and it would be remiss to skip over how to scan for open DNS, DHCP, and other UDP service hosts.

Like other port scans UDP will try to enumerate 1000 ports by default. The main issue for standard UDP scans is empty UDP probes rarely return results. For that reason, it is recommended to enable version scanning using -sV (or -sUV to combine the two options into one) so Nmap can try to more accurately enumerate open ports, services, and in this case even versions.

There are a handful of options to speed up UDP scans, such as -F to scan less ports, `--version-intensity 0` to use only more common version detection probes, `--max-retries 0` to limit retries, and others. Check them out online if you need to use them.


## And that about covers it
