I passed!

I was pretty confident after my review that I would do well enough to make it but the test still felt pretty tough. I finished watching the last couple of Professor Messer’s course videos the morning of, and did some last minute review of my flash cards in the parking lot as much to remind myself I know the material as to actually review. The exam had 3 PBQs and 77 questions for 80 total problems and my final score was a 773/900. I’ve been following the CompTIA subreddit for study tips and suggestions and it seems most people pass Net+ with scores between about 750 and 800 or so, I landed right in the middle.

I’m tempted to dive right into studying for Security+ to finish the CompTIA trifecta but I think at this point my time is better spent starting to do more hands-on time with the homelab and tooling. I created a TryHackMe account a couple days ago and started one of the entry level learning paths which is mostly Net+ review so far but seems like it could lead to learning some more in depth network and application security concepts. I also acquired a copy of Learn Active Directory in a Month of Lunches which seems to be highly regarded as a resource and course.

Time to seriously try finding a job!
