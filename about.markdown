Hi!

My name is Sean Lynch. I’m a 33 year old born and raised in Chicago, Illinois. 

I used to work as a Restaurant Manager, a position I held for about 5 years. Before that as a Restaurant Server/Bartender/Driver, sometimes even all three in the same shift. I’m working to break into IT to try and find a better work/life balance and get more time with family and friends. Working nights isn’t so bad, working weekends isn’t so bad, working holidays isn’t so bad, but working nights and weekends and holidays takes a toll.

Why IT? I have always enjoyed learning about and working with tech. Growing up I dreamed of following a career path in IT or programming. I took some detours along the way and now I’m chasing that dream. The last (and only) time I really had a job in tech was summer of ’06 where I did an internship working as the assistant to the Systems Administrator for a convention event registration and management company.

Recently I’ve been keeping busy learning skills to serve me in my new field. That’s most of what this blog is about! During downtime I read Hackernews and recently started listening to the Packet Pushers family of podcasts. Outside of tech I like listening to music and going to shows, and hope to start practicing DJing again soon. I used to dabble in photography and would like to pick that back up with some of my newfound free time. This year I also have my very own lawn for the first time, and I’m gearing up to try and get it in tip top shape this season.

You can connect with me via LinkedIn or of course here at this blog.
